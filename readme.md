 ## **Product Backlog (Epics and User Stories)** 
  
 **Epic 1: Window Selection** 
 - *US1:* As a user, I want to see a list of all open windows so I can select which one I want to capture. 
  
 **Epic 2: Region Selection** 
 - *US2:* As a user, I want to interactively select a rectangular region on my screen, similar to Flameshot, to precisely define the capture area. 
  
 **Epic 3: Window Control and Screenshot Capture** 
 - *US3:* As a user, I want the application to focus and control the selected window so that keyboard automation (e.g., PageDown) is sent to the correct target. 
 - *US4:* As a user, I want the app to take an initial screenshot of my selected region. 
 - *US5:* As a user, I want the app to automatically send the PageDown key to the selected window and capture another screenshot of the same region after scrolling. 
  
 **Epic 4: Smart Stitching** 
 - *US6:* As a user, I want the app to automatically compare the consecutive screenshots, detect and remove overlapping parts, and stitch only the new content to create a seamless, scrolling screenshot. 
  
 **Epic 5: Output and Feedback** 
 - *US7:* As a user, I want the final output as a single image file showing all the content in the selected region, merged without visible seams. 
 - *US8:* As a user, I want clear feedback (console messages or UI) about each step and when the process is complete.

 ## **Acceptance Criteria** 
  
 **US1: Window Selection** 
 - [ ] On launch, the tool lists all open visible windows with human-readable titles. 
 - [ ] User can select any window from the list for subsequent actions. 
  
 **US2: Region Selection** 
 - [ ] After window selection, user can draw a rectangular region overlay on the screen. 
 - [ ] The selected region’s coordinates are clearly indicated and used for subsequent screenshots. 
  
 **US3: Window Control** 
 - [ ] The script brings the selected window to foreground before sending key events. 
 - [ ] Only the selected window receives the automated PageDown event. 
  
 **US4: Initial Screenshot** 
 - [ ] Clicking “start” or confirming region instantly takes a screenshot of the specified area. 
  
 **US5: Scroll and Capture** 
 - [ ] The tool can simulate a PageDown (or other user-defined) scroll event and waits for content to update. 
 - [ ] A second screenshot is taken of the exact same region. 
  
 **US6: Automatic Overlap Detection and Stitching** 
 - [ ] The tool compares the two consecutive screenshots and identifies the overlapping area automatically (pixel-based comparison). 
 - [ ] Only the new, non-overlapping part of the latest screenshot is appended to the bottom of the previous image. 
 - [ ] The stitching is seamless (no duplication of content). 
  
 **US7: Final Output** 
 - [ ] The resulting stitched image is saved as a standard file (e.g., PNG), covering the full scrolled region without visible seams. 
 - [ ] The image is available in the working directory or user-specified location. 
 - [ ] The process can be repeated to extend the stitched image further. 
  
 **US8: User Feedback** 
 - [ ] The tool provides console (and optionally GUI) messages at each major step: window selection, region selection, capture, scrolling, stitching, completion. 
 - [ ] On error (unable to capture, no window selected, etc.) user receives a clear, actionable error message.

 **Definition of Done:**   
 All acceptance criteria in this list are satisfied, minimal requirements are met, and the tool performs seamlessly in a typical X11-based Linux GUI environment as required.

 Certainly! Here are **User Stories** and **Minimal Requirements** for your scrolling screenshot application, based on our conversation: 
  
 --- 
  
 ### **Minimal Requirements (excluding Python dependencies)** 
  
 1. **Linux Desktop with X11**:   
    The system must use the X Window System (X11), not Wayland, to enable window management and automation tools. 
  
 2. **Graphical Environment**:   
    The user must have a graphical desktop session, allowing for window enumeration, focus, and region selection overlays. 
  
 3. **`wmctrl` Utility Installed**:   
    The `wmctrl` system tool must be installed and available for enumerating and focusing windows. 
  
 4. **Permission to Simulate Input and Capture Screen**:   
    The script must be executed with sufficient user permissions to simulate keyboard input (for scrolling) and capture the screen contents. 
  
 5. **Visible, Non-minimized Windows**:   
    The target application window (e.g., LibreOffice Writer) must be open, non-minimized, and visible on the desktop during the capture process. 
  
 6. **Stable Target Window Content**:   
    The scrolling and rendering behavior of the target window should be stable and not produce unpredictable visual changes (e.g., smooth scrolling is recommended to avoid mismatches). 
  
 7. **Display Scaling Consistency**:   
    Display scaling and multi-monitor setups should be consistent to ensure the selected screenshot region maps correctly for capture and input sending. 
  
 8. **Adequate Disk Space**:   
    There should be enough storage space to save temporary and final image files.
