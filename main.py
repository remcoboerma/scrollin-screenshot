You got it! Here’s a **complete, documented Python script** that:

- Presents a GUI dropdown listing all open windows (using `wmctrl`).
- Lets you select a window.
- Lets you select a rectangle region on the screen (interactive, à la Flameshot).
- Automatically focuses that window, captures an initial screenshot of the selection.
- Sends PageDown, captures the next screenshot.
- Shows how to (optionally) auto-stitch the newly revealed region (see note in code).
- Is written for **X11-based Linux** (Wayland support would require different tooling).

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt install wmctrl       # for window enumeration/switching
pip install pyautogui mss pillow pyqt5
```
